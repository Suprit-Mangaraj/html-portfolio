    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I am a 20-year-old undergraduate student currently entering my 3rd year in Electronics and Computer Science Engineering at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), Bhubaneswar. I completed my higher secondary education from DAV Public School, Pokhariput, and have developed a strong interest in the intersection of software and hardware systems.<br />
        My project work includes building IoT-based systems using Arduino and ESP32, such as a self-driving rover, voice-controlled automation, and sensor-integrated medical assistant prototypes. I have hands-on experience with Blynk, real-time data monitoring, and interfacing with various sensors. Iâ€™m also strengthening my programming skills in C++, Python, and DSA, and exploring AI/ML through self-learning and applied projects.
